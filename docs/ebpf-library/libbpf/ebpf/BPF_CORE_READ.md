# Libbpf eBPF macro `BPF_CORE_READ`

[:octicons-tag-24: v0.0.6](https://github.com/libbpf/libbpf/releases/tag/v0.0.6)

The `BPF_CORE_READ` macro is used to simplify BPF CO-RE relocatable read, especially when there are few pointer chasing steps.

## Definition

```c
#define BPF_CORE_READ(src, a, ...) ({					    \
	___type((src), a, ##__VA_ARGS__) __r;				    \
	BPF_CORE_READ_INTO(&__r, (src), a, ##__VA_ARGS__);		    \
	__r;								    \
})
```

## Usage

`BPF_CORE_READ` is used to simplify BPF CO-RE relocatable read, especially when there are few pointer chasing steps. E.g., what in non-BPF world (or in BPF w/ BCC) would be something like:

`#!c int x = s->a.b.c->d.e->f->g;`

can be succinctly achieved using `BPF_CORE_READ` as:

`#!c int x = BPF_CORE_READ(s, a.b.c, d.e, f, g);`

`BPF_CORE_READ` will decompose above statement into 4 [`bpf_core_read`](bpf_core_read.md) (BPF CO-RE relocatable [`bpf_probe_read_kernel`](../../../linux/helper-function/bpf_probe_read_kernel.md) wrapper) calls, logically equivalent to:

 1. `const void *__t = s->a.b.c;`
 2. `__t = __t->d.e;`
 3. `__t = __t->f;`
 4. `return __t->g;`

Equivalence is logical, because there is a heavy type casting/preservation involved, as well as all the reads are happening through [`bpf_probe_read_kernel`](../../../linux/helper-function/bpf_probe_read_kernel.md) calls using `__builtin_preserve_access_index`() to emit CO-RE relocations.

!!! note
    Only up to 9 "field accessors" are supported, which should be more than enough for any practical purpose.
